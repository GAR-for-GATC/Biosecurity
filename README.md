# Biosecurity
UT iGEM 2013 Biosecurity Project

This project was made in collaberation with the 2013 iGEM Synthetic biology team in conjunction to their other projects.  
This section of the project focused on using the BLAST algorithm to search through a user generated database of genomes
for homologous sequences of DNA strands.  We wanted to verify that small pieces of DNA can be searched for and found with
high fidelity, which is contrary to what some DNA manufacturers have claimed in the past.  This is important because many 
people with nefarious designs could order short sequences of DNA and build a dangerous viral genome; an event that should
be prevented.  The resulting code was used to search for, parse and generate our results.
